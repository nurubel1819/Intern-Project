## ðŸ§  Task Overview

### âœ… Task 1: Notification Feature Integration using SOLID Principles â€” `5 Hours`

- Integrated a **Notification module** into the project following **SOLID design principles**:
  - **S**ingle Responsibility: Separated notification logic from controller/service layers.
  - **O**pen/Closed: New notification types (email, UI) can be added without modifying existing code.
  - **L**iskov Substitution: Abstracted base notification class/interface used.
  - **I**nterface Segregation: Split interfaces for senders and receivers.
  - **D**ependency Inversion: Notification logic depends on abstractions, not concrete classes.

- Created interfaces like:
  - `INotificationSender`
  - `UINotificationSender`
  - `EmailNotificationSender`

- Applied Spring Boot dependency injection to manage these services.
