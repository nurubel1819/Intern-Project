### Task-1: Update Project Features (8 Hours)

**Description:** Focused on updating existing features within the project, addressing user login redirection, default date filtering, and API version updates.

**Details:**
* **User Login Redirection:** Implemented a new redirection rule: Upon successful login, if the user is identified as a "Doctor," they are now automatically directed to the "Show Prescription Page." This enhances the user experience and streamlines the workflow for medical professionals.
* **Default Date Filter:** Configured the default date range filter to display the "current month." This improves usability by providing a relevant initial view for users when interacting with date-sensitive data.
* **API Version Update:** Updated the project to utilize the latest version of the API. This ensures compatibility, access to new features, and potentially improved performance and security.
