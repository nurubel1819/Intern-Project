## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Dummy Data Upload Integrated**
   - Implemented a controller method to upload sample users and lab tests into the system.

2. **User Interface Updated for Dummy Data Upload**
   - Added UI component/button to trigger dummy data upload.
   - After upload, users are redirected to the login page for further actions.

3. **Spring Security Configuration Modified**
   - Unauthorized access now properly redirects to the login page (`/login`) instead of showing HTTP 403 error.
   - Improved JWT filter behavior to allow clean redirection for unauthenticated users.

4. **Doctor Registration Page Moved to Admin Panel**
   - Secured the doctor registration route.
   - Made it accessible only to users with the `ADMIN` role.
   - Removed public access from security configuration.

5. **Alert Box Added to Doctor Registration Form**
   - Used Thymeleaf and CSS (no JavaScript) to show validation messages like:
     - "Invalid phone number"
     - "User not registered"
     - "Phone/email already exists"
   - Improved UX for form validation feedback.
