# ✅ Today's Work Progress - [Date: 2025-05-18]

## 🔐 Spring Security Integration

- Added **Spring Security Authorization** support to the frontend application.
- Implemented secure route access with JWT-based user authentication.

## 🍪 Cookie-Based Authorization

- Configured frontend to use **HTTP-only Cookies** to manage JWT tokens.
- Authorization logic updated to extract token from `Cookie` instead of `localStorage`.

## ♻️ Code Modifications

- Modified previous implementation:
  - Converted previously public APIs/pages to **authorization-protected**.
  - Ensured routes and API requests now validate based on the presence of valid JWT in the cookie.
