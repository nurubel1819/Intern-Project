# 🗓️ Daily Work Progress – 2025-05-22

This document outlines the completed tasks for the day related to the **Doctor Appointment Booking System** project. All implementations were done following **SOLID principles** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🧩 Task 1: Doctor Time Slot Creation `(4 Hours)`
- Developed a feature to allow doctors to create time slots.
- Applied **SOLID principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Isolated business logic into service layer.
  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Code is extensible for new types of slot logic without modifying existing ones.
  - **Interface Segregation & Dependency Inversion:** Used interfaces to decouple slot services from controllers.
- Validated time inputs and prevented duplicate or conflicting slots.
- Wrote unit and integration tests for slot creation.

### 🕒 Task 2: Show Available Time Slots to All Users `(2 Hours)`
- Implemented frontend and backend logic to display available slots for doctors.
- Used DTOs to pass only necessary information to the frontend.
- Ensured the logic is reusable and scalable for different types of users.
- Followed **Liskov Substitution Principle** to maintain integrity while extending base behavior.
- Maintained clear separation of concerns between services and controllers.

---

### 🚫 Task 3: Handle Unavailable Doctors `(2 Hours)`
- Added handling for cases when doctors have no available time slots.
- Displayed informative messages on the UI using Thymeleaf.
- Backend safely checks and returns empty results instead of nulls.
- Used the **Strategy Pattern** to support flexible handling logic.
- Ensured user experience remains smooth with or without available slots.
